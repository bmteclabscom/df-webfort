## INSTALLING ##

### FROM BINARY ###

If you recieved your copy of Webfort as a windows binary, this is the procedure
to follow.

1. Installing the plugin.

One half of Webfort is the dfhack plugin that gets added directly to your Dwarf
Fortress install. Because Web Fortress requires that many of your settings and
keybindings get changed, it's recommended you install it in a new copy of Dwarf
Fortress. You will need
* Dwarf Fortress 0.34.11 (the last DF2012 release)
	http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/older_versions.html
* DFHack 0.34.11-r5
	https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/releases/tag/0.34.11-r5

Or just get the LNP pack, and deinstall TWBT:

Once you have a copy of Dwarf Fortress with both those installed, you can just
enter the plugin/ folder, select everything inside, and drag it into your DF
folder. You should get asked to overwrite some files. Say "yes".

After that, you can test that Web Fortress is correctly installed by running
Dwarf Fortress. In the DFHack Console, you should see a line that says:

	[WEBFORT] [2014-11-10 06:11:06] [application] Web Fortress started on port 1234

If you see something like that, then Web Fortress has been properly installed.

2. Running the frontend

To connect to your fortress, users will need to connect to a webserver serving
the files located in the static/ folder. You can either:

* Use somebody else's hosted version of these files:

	http://alloyed.me/webfort/v2.0/webfort.html?host=<YOUR IP ADDRESS>

Just replace <YOUR IP ADDRESS> with your actual IP. It can be found by typing
"What is my IP Address" into Google.

* Host them yourself

Any server that can host static files will do. Mongoose is easy to use.

3. Port Forwarding

For external users to connect to your webfort, they will need to access port
1234, and port 8080 if you installed Mongoose. This is typically done using the
Port Forwarding settings on your router.

### From Source ###

Installing from the github source is less well implemented. Following the
COMPILING.md instructions, you should be able to install using the cmake
install command. Then, afterward, you will need to manually copy everything
over from the server/dist folder into your DF install. Everything else should
be identical to the binary install.
